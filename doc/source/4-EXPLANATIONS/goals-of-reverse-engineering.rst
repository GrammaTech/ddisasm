geopolitical analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Today, most of the malware come from countries that protect the malware authors. It is then impossible to pursuie the author. We can still use malware analysis in order to:

* write article about cyber defense in newspaper in order to alert and sensibilize people about cyber war threats


judiciary analysis
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Sometime when the malware author is an individual (it is very very uncoommon and generally not dangerous as they mostly just do it for research purpose) from a local country, we migth want to pursuie him in justice.
