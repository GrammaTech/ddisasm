Case 1: Modding the video game pwn island
=========================================


Introduction
------------

Modding is the art to modify a video game or a software *with no source code* in order to make it better and customize it. It could be considered as malicious by some copyright owner as well as an act of freedom by free software defenders. Let's stay far from the melee and focus on the technic.

In order to avoid any copyright attempt, we will focus on a video game made to be reversed to teach reverse engineering. It name is pwn island.
